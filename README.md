# üçï Project Overview: Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL üçï

In the fast-paced world of pizza sales, understanding customer preferences and maximizing revenue is crucial! This project dives into the store's sales data to uncover key insights and trends using SQL. By analyzing everything from popular pizza types to peak order times and revenue distribution, we aim to help the store make smarter, data-driven decisions that will boost both customer satisfaction and profitability.
## üéØ Key Objectives

The primary aim of this project was to answer critical business questions related to pizza sales and provide data-driven insights for decision-making. These include:

### Basic Queries:
1. **Total Orders**: Retrieve the total number of pizza orders placed.
2. **Revenue Calculation**: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. **Highest-Priced Pizza**: Identify the most expensive pizza on the menu.
4. **Popular Pizza Size**: Identify the most common pizza size ordered by customers.
5. **Top Pizza Types**: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

### Intermediate Queries:
1. **Category-Wise Sales**: Join tables to find the total quantity of pizzas ordered in each category.
2. **Hourly Sales Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of pizza orders by hour of the day.
3. **Category-Wise Distribution**: Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. **Daily Sales Average**: Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. **Top Pizza Types by Revenue**: Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### Advanced Queries:
1. **Revenue Contribution**: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2. **Cumulative Revenue**: Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
3. **Category-Wise Top Pizza Types**: Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category
   
## üõ† Approach
In this project, I used structured SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the pizza sales dataset. The approach involved:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explored the dataset to understand its structure, relationships between tables, and identified key fields like `order_id`, `pizza_id`, `price`, `category`, and `order_time` that were essential for the analysis.
2. **Query Execution**: Developed SQL queries to answer critical business questions, including total orders, revenue calculation, identifying popular pizzas, and determining sales trends by category and time.
3. **Data Insights**: Analyzed the query results to extract valuable insights, such as identifying top-selling pizzas, peak hours of operation, and understanding the contribution of each pizza type to overall revenue. This helped in making data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales and menu offerings.
   
## üéâ Conclusion
In the world of pizza sales, every order tells a story, and this project uncovered those stories through data. By diving deep into the sales dataset, we transformed raw numbers into powerful insights‚Äîrevealing not just the most popular pizzas, but the hidden patterns that drive customer behavior. From understanding peak hours to uncovering the revenue giants on the menu, this analysis paints a clear picture of where the business thrives and where there's room to grow.
The ability to track and predict sales trends enables smarter decisions, whether it‚Äôs launching a promotion, adjusting the menu, or managing resources more efficiently. This project goes beyond just answering business questions; it serves as a roadmap for driving profitability and customer satisfaction in the ever-competitive pizza industry. With these insights, the pizza business is now better equipped to deliver both delicious pies and a top-tier customer experience‚Äîone slice at a time.
## üñ•Ô∏è Technology Used
**SQL (Structured Query Language)**: The primary technology for querying and manipulating data. SQL was used to retrieve, filter, join, and aggregate data from multiple tables to answer business questions and provide insights into pizza sales.
